# Random-Password-Generator-using-JAVA

INTRODUCTION: 
 The random password generator that makes passwords with random numbers and letters!
In order to do this, we are going to use ASCII. ASCII is a language in which every possible character is represented by a number. This standard ensures that computers can communicate to each other about characters properly.
This is a more challenging project for beginners, but you certainly have the ability to do it as long as you are familiar with Java concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and random numbers.

Steps to Code the Project:
•	Create a function that generates a random character, which can be a number, a lowercase letter, or an uppercase letter.
•	Create a random password 

OBJECTIVE:
    To generate random passwords using the java code.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
	The java 8 version requires following hardware configuration:
•	RAM: At least 128 MB
•	Disk Space: 124 MB for JRE, 2 MB for Java Update
•	Processor: Minimum Pentium 2 266 MHz processor
	An editor like notepad, notepad++, Text Pad, etc. for windows operating system 
	Any terminal like cmd, shell etc. to compile and run java program. By default, CMD is available in windows OS.
	Java development kit (JDK).

PREREQUISITE:
Basic JAVA concepts like Arrays, Random numbers, ASCII, Functions, Variables
Input & output, loops, conditionals etc.

DESCRIPTION OF SOURCE CODE:
 Our program prints out the random password it generated. Note that the random passwords consist of both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers!

CONCLUSION:
This technique gives several benefits to users such as security, and confidentiality. The password generated using proposed technique is more secure because it is chosen from a large distribution of passwords and is stronger than user created passwords.
